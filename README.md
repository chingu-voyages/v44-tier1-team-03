## HTML/CSS/JavaScript Structure:

This uses the BEM Methodology (Block, Element, Modifier).

HTML tags have a few classes first a specific name i.e. menu, single-player, player-player etc... to be used for JavaScript purposes.

For the grid layout HTML tags have class names of tag-use or for example body-grid for the main grid of that section. Then each element within has tag-use__tag for each section of the grid body-grid__main for the purpose of any movement of items within that may be needed. The body clasess are within the css/layout/body.css file, header classes and any direct child is in the css/layout/header.css file etc...
